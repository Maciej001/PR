			%p
				We talk thousands. 1 tick is worth 10 Paycoins. You start with 100.000 Paycoins. 
			%h4 Example
			%p
				You bought 10 contracts at 245k (245.000). Actual figure was, to your suprise, 267.000.
				%br/
				Your profit is 10 contracts * (267 - 245) * 10 tick value. 
				%br/
				That is 2.200 Paycoins!
